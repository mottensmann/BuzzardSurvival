*Due to a 100 MB size limit, the data file `models.barker.adj.RDS` can not be uploaded to GitHub in the moment*

* **01_R_code.Rmd** contains the code to reproduce all analyses and figures presented in the manuscript. 
* **02_R_code.Rmd** Supplementary analysis of the capture-mark-resighting data using the burnham models.
* **03_R_code.Rmd** Supplementary analysis of the capture-mark-resighting data using the CJS models. 

## **`data`**
This folder contains raw data and cached results of the capture-mark-resighting analysis. The most important raw data files are listed below.

+ **ringing_data.csv**: Individual-specific data of 3463 common buzzards. Note, a subset of 2723 individuals is used in capture-mark-resighting models.

+ **resighting_data.csv**: Data on 2940 resighting events, of which 2793 correspond to individuals represented in  capture-mark-resighting models.   

+ **nao.txt** contains North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) indices derived from https://climatedataguide.ucar.edu/climate-data/hurrell-north-atlantic-oscillation-nao-index-pc-based

+ **climate.data.RDS**: Climate data (air temperature, precipitation levels and days with snow) from eight stations of the German Weather Service (DWD).

## **`R`**
+ **custom_functions.R**: R scripts implementing several data wrangling steps, including the creation of capture histories for capture-mark-resighting models, bootstrapping procedures etc. 

## **plots**
Contains all figures that are presented in the manuscript or supplementary files.
